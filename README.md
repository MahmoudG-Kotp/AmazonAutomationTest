# Amazon Automation Test

Amazon Automation Test is an automated software test application that has been developed as an interview task for the MDI corporation. The app is designed to apply test scenarios on the Amazon EG website https://www.amazon.eg/ by utilizing Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber BDD framework, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.


The app demonstrates the functionality of automation testing by simulating multiple user journeys and interactions to identify problems or errors in the website's functionality e.g.(Authentication, Login, Orders, and Cart), The app's primary focus is to ensure that the website's quality is top-notch in terms of performance, usability, functionality, and security, hence ensuring user satisfaction.


The entire test suite has been developed using the Cucumber BDD framework, which facilitates smooth communication between the developers, testers, and product owners by specifying the requirements in a natural language format, which is easily understandable by all stakeholders.


Moreover, the project has been implemented using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which makes it easier to maintain code standards, separation of concerns, and reusability of code snippets. Each page element or function of the website is defined as classes with their respective locators and related function.


The app has been designed to be scalable and easy to maintain to keep up with website functionality changes. It can be used as a model of what a robust automation testing suite should look like while also giving a clear idea of how to improve a testing suite's quality to improve its success rate.
